David, Cindy, Ivy

Requirements 
------
Our project requires several free packages to help solve our routing problem.
Use package manager pip to install scikit learn, networkx, NumPy and ORTools. Without these packages the program will fail to run. 

```bash
pip install -U scikit-learn
```
```bash
pip install numpy
```
```bash
pip install networkx
```
```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade --user ortools
```
Now you are ready!
